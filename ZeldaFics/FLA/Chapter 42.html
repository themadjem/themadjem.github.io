<body><div><b>Five Links' Adventures</b></u></p><p><u><b>Chapter 42: Doc Bandum and Blu Chu</b></u></p><p>The five Links were sitting round the dining table; with the order going round at Red, Blue, Vio, Shadow and then Green. They had finished eating all of Vios' chicken noodle curry.</p><p>"Ah, Vio! That was really delicious!" Green said.</p><p>"Yeah! You should cook more for us!" Red said.</p><p>"Thanks, guys! Eheheheheheh.." Vio laughed.</p><p>"Right! OK, so.." Green said, "We need to get back to Hyrule. But what do we need to get there?"</p><p>"A boat!" Blue said.</p><p>"A bike!" Red said.</p><p>"A car!"</p><p>"A plane!"</p><p>"Are we close?" Blue asked.</p><p>"No! A map, you idiots!" Green said, "So where do we get a map from?"</p><p>"A map salesman!" Red said.</p><p>"A market?" Blue asked.</p><p>"A shop?"</p><p>"Yes! That's it! A shop!" Green said, "So, where do we find a shop?"</p><p>"In a shop shop!" Red said.</p><p>"A town?" Blue asked.</p><p>"A city!"</p><p>"Yes! Yes! In this city!" Green said, "...But what do we need to get around the city?"</p><p>"A bike!" Red said.</p><p>"Rollarskates!" Blue said.</p><p>Vio sighed, "Not this question again.."</p><p>"We could be here all day." Shadow said.</p><p>The five Links were walking down a long street, heading for the city centre. Red was holding a fold-out map of the city.</p><p>"Good thing the hospital have these easy-to-read maps for free." Red said.</p><p>"The hospital is the easiest place for visitors to get to." Green explained, "So it's a really big help."</p><p>The five Links got to the large city centre. There was a huge fountain in the middle and there were various shops all around.</p><p>"Wow!" Red looked around, "It's huge!"</p><p>Blue looked ahead of him and pointed, "Hey, look. It's the guy I faught, it's Ralph!"</p><p>Ralph was infront of the fountain with camera men and interviewers all around him.</p><p>"Ralph, please tell everyone.." an interviewer said, "How is this first loss from your 100th fight going to affect you?"</p><p>"My 100th match..ah, yes.." Ralph looked smug, "The challenger was a very worthy foe, surviving longer than all the others. But I have to admit, I let him win since he was so scrawny."</p><p>"Scrawny!" Blue tried to run at Ralph but Green and Shadow held his arms back.</p><p>"No, Blue. You shouldn't ruin him on live TV." Green said.</p><p>Blue sighed, "Fine. Just because he's my friend.."</p><p>Ralph didn't notice the five Links walk by as he was too distracted by the cameras.</p><p>"But, don't worry! Don't think I'm gonna give up now! I'll get stronger and better than before!" Ralph pointed into the camera, "So, Blue! You better get prepared for your re-match! I won't be so easy!"</p><p>It was 4:45pm. The five Links were sitting in the park, on a bench. The order they were sitting in was Blue, Red, Shadow, Vio and then Green. Blue was sitting on the end, facing away from the others. Vio had his arm round Shadow with his hand on Shadows' side, gently stroking him and very slowly moving his hand lower and lower. They each had a cookie in their hand and were, very strangely, eating them in unison.</p><p>"Man, three hours and not even a map leading anywhere near Hyrule." Green said, "We must be really far away."</p><p>"Atleast the day's not a total loss." Red smiled, "We got these cookies!"</p><p>"And I got my new hookshot." Blue smirked.</p><p>Vio looked up into the sky, in a gap inbetween the trees, "Wow, look at that sky. It's perfect."</p><p>Shadow leaned his head on Vios' shoulder and stroked his cheek against it.</p><p>"You lovebirds." Green commented.</p><p>"Eheheheh.." Vio blushed slightly.</p><p>Vios' hand had moved to below Shadows' waist, without his notice. Vio rubbed and gently pressed into the top of Shadows' ass. Shadows' head quickly perked up and he blushed. He gulped down his bitefull of cookie and almost choked on it. He thumped on his chest and Vio rubbed his back.</p><p>Shadow swallowed, "Don't worry, I'm OK..Phew.."</p><p>Blue turned his head round, "What happened there, Shadow?"</p><p>Shadow blushed a lot, "Um..uh...I just swallowed too much too quickly! That's all!" He quickly ate the rest of his cookie, stood up and turned to the others, "I'm gonna go take a walk and stretch my legs for a minute. I'll be back soon, guys."</p><p>Shadow ran off through some trees behind the bench.</p><p>"Is he OK?" Green asked.</p><p>Vio smirked, "Oh, don't worry. He's alright."</p><p>Shadow ran up to the edge of a lake and sat down on the grass.</p><p>He panted, "..Oh, Vio-kun..Being so daring like that.." Shadow looked out at the lake and his face lightened up, "Ah, wow! What a beautiful lake!"</p><p>Shadow leaned himself forward to look at the lake. Some bubbles came up to the surface infront of Shadow.</p><p>He looked down at them, "Huh? A fish?"</p><p>A blue chu chu, with electricity sparking around it, poked its' head out of the water and looked at Shadow.</p><p>"Wha! A chu chu!" Shadow sat back and shielded himself with his arm, "I don't have anything to defend myself with!"</p><p>The chu chu smiled and oozed toward Shadow. It rubbed itself up against Shadows' body.</p><p>"H-huh? I'm not getting harmed?" Shadow asked.</p><p>"He wants you to stroke him." a voice said behind Shadow.</p><p>"Huh?" Shadows' head perked up and he turned his head round.</p><p>A man wearing a red lab coat was standing behind Shadow. He had a bald head, red bags under his eyes, a long nose and one square tooth sticking out. He had green goggles around his head and he wore blue trousers and red shoes.</p><p>The man smiled, "Go ahead, stroke him."</p><p>"Um, OK." Shadow turned his head back round.</p><p>Shadow slowly put his hand on the blue chu chus' head and prepared himself to feel the electric shock. It never came and Shadow perked up.</p><p>"There's no..electric shock?" Shadow asked.</p><p>Shadow then stroked the blue chu chus' head and the chu chu bounced up and down in delight.</p><p>Shadow smiled, "Aaw, you're kinda cute, little guy!" Shadow held the blue chu chu in his arms and stood up. He turned round to the man, "Hey, how'd you know he wouldn't hurt me?"</p><p>"Because electric chu chus only hurt people when they feel threatened or afraid." the man explained, "I'm Doc Bandum, an expert on chu chus and chu jelly."</p><p>"My name's Shadow. It's nice to meet you."</p><p>The blue chu chu lept from Shadows' arms into Doc Bandums' arms.</p><p>"And this is my friend, Blu Chu." Doc Bandum smiled, "He likes you a lot."</p><p>"Chuuuuuuuu!" Blu Chu cried.</p><p>"Wow! He can speak!" Shadow was amazed.</p><p>"Yeah, but 'chu' is all he can say. He's very proud of his talent though."</p><p>"Chu chu!"</p><p>"Wow.." Shadow said, "How did he become so friendly? I mean..chu chus are usually seen as enemies."</p><p>Doc Bandum smiled, "Hm hm, well, he saved my life."</p><p>"Huh? How?"</p><p>"Well, it was a few weeks ago. I decided I wanted to move to this city from Windfall island to make my business bigger. I travelled by boat over the sea but between this city and the shore is a wide desert. I underestimated how big it was and didn't bring enough water with me."</p><p>Doc Bandum was walking through the desert in a sandstorm blowing toward him.</p><p>"N..no...I have to get there...I have to get to City Ishidukuri..." Doc Bandum then collapsed and fell unconscious.</p><p>"The next thing I remember after that is waking up near a small lake and a few trees hidden somewhere in the desert."</p><p>Doc Bandum sat up, "Huh? I'm alive?"</p><p>A blue electric chu chu rubbed up against Doc Bandum in worry.</p><p>"Huh?" Doc Bandum looked down at the chu chu, "Don't worry, I'm OK." he smiled and petted the blue chu chu, "You must've saved me, huh?"</p><p>The chu chu looked up at Doc Bandum and nodded.</p><p>Doc Bandum took a long, refreshing drink from the lake and filled up his water jug.</p><p>Doc Bandum walked out to the sand of the desert, "OK, so City Ishidukuri is in the north-east.." he licked his finger and he pointed up into the air. He felt the wind direction and looked up at the suns' location. Doc Bandum turned round and pointed north-east, infront of him, "That way!"</p><p>He begun his walk again and headed for the city. The blue chu chu looked at him and followed behind.</p><p>Doc Bandum turned his head round, "Huh? Are you following me?"</p><p>The blue chu chu continued to follow Doc Bandum. He turned his head back round and smirked. He then suddenly stopped and turned round. The blue chu chu stopped right infront of Doc Bandum as he knelt down.</p><p>Doc Bandum smiled, "Whether I like it or not, you're gonna follow me wherever I go, right?"</p><p>The blue chu chu nodded and then jumped into Doc Bandums' arms.</p><p>"And we've been together ever since." Doc Bandum explained.</p><p>"Windfall island. That's where Green landed at." Shadow looked up to Doc Bandum, "Do you know the way to Hyrule from Windfall? Or if it's anywhere near there?"</p><p>"Hmmm, Hyrule. That's very far south-east from Windfall. From here it's very far south. So it's the same distance from both Windfall and this city to Hyrule."</p><p>"Aw man.." Shadow sighed, "Atleast we know it's south from here."</p><p>"Huh? We?"</p><p>"Yeah, me and my other friends need to get to Hyrule."</p><p>"I see. But you can't just start heading south. You need to be prepared for the different climates on the way."</p><p>Shadow nodded, "We need a map to know what's out there. But we looked around all afternoon and couldn't find any leading anywhere close to Hyrule."</p><p>"Hmmm...Where you staying?"</p><p>"At the hospital." Shadow perked up, "Oh! I should get back to my friends." Shadow started running back and waved behind him, "It was nice meeting you guys!"</p><p>"Chu chuuuu!" Blu Chu called out.</p><p>Doc Bandum smirked, "Don't worry, Blu Chu. We'll meet him again.."</p>
