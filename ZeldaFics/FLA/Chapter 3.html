<body><div><b>Five Links' Adventures</b></u></p><p><u><b>Chapter 3: The Speaking Treasure</b></u></p><p>Red ran up to the treasure chest.</p><p>"So, what's in this anyway?" Red asked.</p><p>The others walked up to it.</p><p>"Well, there's only one way to find out!" Blue said.</p><p>Blue grabbed the edge of the lid and tried to lift it, but it wouldn't budge.</p><p>"Aw, man! It's way heavy!"</p><p>The lid lifted a bit.</p><p>"Come on! Let's help!" Green said.</p><p>They all grabbed the lid and tried to lift it. It took all their strength to eventually open the chest. Red reached in and pulled out a shiny, light blue stone. It had some black string attached to it, like a necklace.</p><p>"Hey, what is it?" Red asked.</p><p>"Who knows." Blue said.</p><p>"It looks kinda broken." Vio said, "Maybe there's another piece to it."</p><p>"If you want to find the other piece, head to Kumalon Village in the west." a mysterious voice said.</p><p>Everyone was looking around.</p><p>"Where did that come from!" Green asked.</p><p>"It came from this stone!" Red said, "It was glowing when there was that speaking."</p><p>"Well? Why should we go there! It could be a trap!" Blue argued.</p><p>"I'm watching your every move." the voice said again, "If you don't go there, I'll appear and destroy you!"</p><p>"What's the harm in going?" Vio asked, "We can easily beat anything that's waiting for us."</p><p>"Yeah." Green agreed, "We'll help anyone who's there by defeating the bad guy!"</p><p>"To the West!" Blue pointed.</p><p>"Uh, that's east." Vio said.</p><p>"Uh..." Blue pointed the right way, "To the West! Haha!"</p><p>Red tied the string of the stone round his neck.</p><p>"OK! Let's go!" Red ran happily ahead.</p><p>Blue and Green ran after him and Vio walked behind them. They went out of the shrine area and headed west, the opposite way to Hyrule.</p><p>They got to an area with lots of large trees with dark shade under them. Vio stopped under one of the trees, in the dark shade.</p><p>"Hey, guys." Vio said.</p><p>The others turned their heads to him.</p><p>"I think we should bring Shadow back here."</p>
