<body><div><b>Five Links' Adventures</b></u></p><p><u><b>Chapter 51: Sea Monster Attack</b></u></p><p>A smile lightened up his face as Shadow slowly opened his eyes from his sleep. He sat up in his bed, which was a low bed in the corner behind the hammocks, and he stretched his arms out.</p><p>He looked down then perked up and blushed as he noticed he was only wearing his pyjama bottoms. He looked to his right and saw his pyjama shirt and Vios' pyjamas by the pillow.</p><p>Disappointment came across Shadows' face, "Vio-kun.."</p><p>Shadow put his hand on his left cheek. His head perked up and he blushed slightly as he felt a slight breath on it.</p><p><i>Vio and Shadow were sleeping, shirt-less, in their bed. Vio had his arms wrapped around Shadow, who was facing away from him and was holding onto Vios' arms.</i></p><p><i>Vio opened his eyes and brought his face closer to Shadows'.</i></p><p><i>He whispered in Shadows' ear, "I need to go. No-one's gaurding the ship. Don't worry. I'll protect you."</i></p><p><i>Vio kissed Shadow on the cheek and Shadow smiled. Vio pulled his arms out from Shadows' grasp then got out of bed and pulled the covers over Shadow.</i></p><p>Shadow smiled, "Oh, Vio-kun!"</p><p>He got out of bed and started getting dressed into his pirate clothes.</p><p>It was a bright, early morning. Vio was standing ontop of the mast, looking around the ship.</p><p>He saw three shark-like creatures, called Gyorgs, swim up to the ship.</p><p>"I won't let you near my Shadow-Chan!" Vio got out his bow and shot three arrows at them.</p><p>Each of the arrows hit the Gyorgs and they puffed away into smoke, which faded away and dropped force into the sea.</p><p>Vio sighed, "It's a shame we can't collect that force.."</p><p>Vios' head perked up as he heard Shadows' voice from below, "Vio-kun!"</p><p>Vio looked down the ladder and his face lightened up, "Shadow-Chan!"</p><p>Shadow climbed up to the top and Vio helped him up to his feet.</p><p>Vio put his hands on Shadows' back and pulled Shadow closer to his body. Shadow placed his hands on Vios' chest and his slightly muscular arm.</p><p>Vio looked into Shadows' eyes, "Did you sleep well last night?" Vio stroked some of Shadows' hair back.</p><p>"Yeah, just fine."</p><p>"That's good to hear.."</p><p>They both closed their eyes as Vio kissed Shadow on the lips.</p><p>The kiss lasted a couple of seconds. Shadow opened his eyes as Vio pulled his lips away. Vio tilted his head and licked Shadows' cheek. Shadow blushed and laughed to himself.</p><p>Vio held Shadow close to his body in his arms. Shadow rested his head on Vios' shoulder. Shadow felt Vios' arm and stroked his chest. He closed his eyes and felt how strong Vios' body and muscles were.</p><p>The others were sleeping peacefully in the bedroom. Blue mumbled in his sleep and reached his arms out like he was trying to grab something. His body turned and he reached far to the side.</p><p>This caused his hammock to flip over and Blue to fall out. Blue landed ontop of Green with him holding onto Greens' hands and their lips kissing each others'.</p><p>Blue and Green suddenly opened their eyes with extremely shocked looks apon their faces as they immediately realised what position they were in.</p><p>They quickly tore apart from each other, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!"</p><p>Vio and Shadows' heads perked up as they heard the loud scream.</p><p>Green was sat up in his hammock, "Aw, man. This is even worse. My second kiss lost..to Blue!"</p><p>Blue was sat up on the floor, "My worst nightmare...Why did it have to come true!"</p><p>Red slowly sat up in his hammock and rubbed his eyes, "Hey, guys. What happened?"</p><p>Green and Blue perked up, "Uh..nothing!"</p><p>Blue stormed outside with Green and Red walking out behind; all of them dressed in their pirate clothes.</p><p>"And we are never to speak of this again!" Blue instructed.</p><p>"Speak of what? What happened?" Red asked.</p><p>Green and Blue turned their heads to him, "We told you! Nothing!"</p><p>Blue looked up to the top of the mast, "Hey, Shadow! Why aren't you making any breakfast!"</p><p>Vio was standing behind Shadow, shooting arrows at more Gyorgs.</p><p>Shadow looked down at Blue, "There's no time!" he pointed in the direction the ship was heading, "We're heading into monster infested waters!"</p><p>Green grinned, "Alright!"</p><p>Green, Blue and Red ran to the front of the ship.</p><p>Green pointed ahead of him, "Let's go!"</p><p>Just then, three huge Seahats; giant pufferfish with fiercesome faces and large propellers circling round them, appeared infront of Green, Blue and Red from below. The three Links froze in fear.</p><p>The three Seahats came slightly closer to the Links. Three bombs suddenly came flying down on the Seahats and destroyed them.</p><p>Green, Blue and Red looked up to Shadow.</p><p>Shadow smirked, "Time to fight!"</p><p>As their ship sailed, more monsters appeared in the sea near them.</p><p>Red and Vio were shooting stones and arrows at the Octoroks. Green threw his boomerang that hit several Gyorgs each time. Blue kept an eye out and he hit Seahats with his hammer when they came close to stun them. Shadow threw a bomb down at the stunned Seahats to destroy them.</p><p>A few minutes passed and no more monsters were seen. Vio and Shadow slid down the sides of the ladder and walked to the front of the ship to the others.</p><p>"Did we get them all?" Green asked.</p><p>"I think so." Vio replied.</p><p>Just then, all fell silent and the Links felt a slight rumble under their ship.</p><p>"What was that?" Red asked.</p><p>Green looked around and then pointed to the left of the ship, "Look!"</p><p>The Links ran to the banisters on the side of the ship. In the sea ahead of them, a large cluster of huge bubbles rushed up to the surface. The ship rumbled more vigerously as a giant white Octorok emerged from the sea. It had many eyes and was 3 times the size of the ship.</p><p>The Links looked up to it and stumbled to the floor as they found their ship slowly going round a whirlpool around the giant Octorok.</p><p>"I-It's huge!" Green said.</p><p>"It's a giant Octo!" Vio said, "That thing sucks up a huge amount of energy and then releases it by shooting a giant block of poisonous ink!"</p><p>"We gotta defeat it before it attacks!" Red said.</p><p>"One hit from that thing and we're done for.." Shadow said.</p><p>"Come on! It's eyes must be its' weak point!" Green instructed.</p><p>"Each eyes takes several hits to defeat!" Vio informed.</p><p>Green threw his boomerang, Red shot stones with his catapult, Vo shot arrows with his bow and Shadow threw bombs. Blue watched the others attack it with his hookshot in his hands.</p><p>"It's...way too strong.." Blue said.</p><p>The Links only managed to defeat one of its' many eyes as it got ready to attack.</p><p>"Wah! No! We're done for!" Green looked shocked.</p><p>The giant Octo shot its' huge attack from its' mouth at the Links' ship.</p>
