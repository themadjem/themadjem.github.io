<body><div><b>Five Links' Adventures</b></u></p><p><u><b>Chapter 44: Kissy Dolls</b></u></p><p>It was 10:15 am. Blue was lying on his bed taking a nap. Vio, Shadow and Green were sitting round the coffee table, playing Jenga. Red was carefully sewing with a thread and needle.</p><p>Red finished the final stitch and bit the excess thread off. His face lightened up.</p><p>Shadow was carefully pulling a Jenga piece out of a hard place.</p><p>"Yay! They're finished!" Red cheered.</p><p>The noise caused Shadow to twitch which caused the Jenga block tower to fall.</p><p>Vio and Green shot their fists up into the air, "Winners!"</p><p>Shadow sighed, "Aw, no fair.."</p><p>Blue woke up and quickly sat up on his bed, "Aah! What happened!"</p><p>"Heheheh! I finished them!" Red smiled.</p><p>The other four Links gathered round Reds' bed. Red had made five small plushies of the five Links.</p><p>"I made dolls of all of us! Do you like 'em?" Red asked.</p><p>They all picked up the dolls of themselves.</p><p>"Wow, they're so cute!" Green said.</p><p>"Aaaw, look at their heads!" Vio commented.</p><p>"These are so impressive, Red!" Shadow said, "And you made them all by yourself?"</p><p>Red nodded, "Yep! Three hours straight and it was all Blues' idea!"</p><p>Blues' head perked up, "No it wasn't! I said to do something constructive!"</p><p>Red smiled, "Yeah, and I constructed these!"</p><p>"He's got a point." Shadow said.</p><p>Blue paused and then sighed, "Fine.."</p><p>A few minutes passed. Blue was lying on his bed, having another nap. Vio, Shadow and Green were clearing up their game of Jenga. Red was tidying up his bed of excess materials and other equipment.</p><p>Red smiled, "There! All tidy!" Red then looked down at his plushies.</p><p>He picked up the Red and Blue dolls and made them face each other.</p><p>Red then pressed their faces together, "Kissy!"</p><p>Just then, Blue woke up from his nap and he got lifted up into the air. He turned around and was then darted at Red.</p><p>"What the!" Blue asked.</p><p>Red turned his head round to Blue and was then being kissed on the lips by him. Blue had a shocked look apon his face.</p><p>Blue pushed himself away from Red and he fell on the floor, between his and Reds' beds.</p><p>Blue looked up at Red, "What the hell just happened!"</p><p>Red blushed, "Oh, Blue! You kissed me again! You really do love me after all!"</p><p>"No, Red! I don't-"</p><p>Blue stood up and turned away from Red, to avoid him from seeing him blushing a lot. Blue then sighed, walked into the bathroom and closed and locked the door behind him.</p><p>Red looked down at his dolls, "These dolls seem to be magic or something.." he thought. Red then smiled, "This could be fun.."</p><p>A few minutes passed. Vio was sitting on the sofa, reading his book. Blue was still in the bathroom. Green was sitting on his bed. Shadow was sitting on Reds' bed with him.</p><p>"So, what did you want to show me?" Shadow asked.</p><p>"Heheheh.." Red picked up the Vio and Green dolls, "Check this out!"</p><p>Red pressed the Green dolls' face against the Vio dolls' face.</p><p>Green started lying back on his bed, "Aah..Time to re-aah!"</p><p>Green suddenly got lifted up into the air and was flying right at Vio.</p><p>"Vio! Watch out!" he yelled.</p><p>Vio looked up at Green, "Huh?"</p><p>"Aaaaaah!"</p><p>"Waaaaaah!"</p><p>Green flew into Vio and kissed him on the lips.</p><p>Blue stepped out of the bathroom and saw them, "Huh? The hell!"</p><p>Red giggled to himself and Shadow quickly pulled the Green doll away from the Vio doll.</p><p>Green was pulled away from Vio and he fell onto the floor behind the chairs. They both held onto their necks and tried to cough the kiss out.</p><p>"I only wanted to be kissed by Shadow-Chan!" Vio said.</p><p>"I wanted my first kiss to be from a girl!" Green said.</p><p>"There's something I thought I'd never see.." Blue commented.</p><p>Blue walked up to the kitchen counter. He reached for a mug and turned the kettle on.</p><p>Shadow picked up the Blue and Red dolls, "So, it works like this.." Shadow pressed the Red dolls' face against the Blue doll.</p><p>Red was lifted into the air and flew toward Blue.</p><p>"Blue!" Red reached his arms out.</p><p>Blue turned round, "Ah, no!"</p><p>Red put his arms round Blue and kissed him on the lips. Blue quickly pushed Red away from him and he stood on the ground.</p><p>Blue looked at Shadow, "Shadow!"</p><p>"Eheheheh, I never knew dolls were so fun!" Shadow said.</p><p>Blue quickly turned round, away from Red to avoid him seeing him blushing.</p><p>It came to 11 o'clock. Shadow and Blue were relaxing on their beds. Vio was reading his book on his bed. Green and Red were looking at the view out the window.</p><p>They heard a knock on the door.</p><p>"Chuuuuu!"</p><p>Shadow quickly sat up, "Blu Chu?"</p><p>Shadow got off his bed and ran to the door. The others followed behind him. Shadow opened the door to Doc Bandum and Blu Chu on his shoulder.</p><p>"Chuu!" Blu Chu jumped from his shoulder into Shadows' arms.</p><p>Shadow stroked him, "Hey, Blu Chu! It's nice to see you!" Shadow looked up to Doc Bandum, "Doc Bandum! What are you doing here?"</p><p>Doc Bandum smiled, "Shadow, I got a surprise for you."</p><p>Doc Bandum reached into his coat and pulled out a brownish, slightly torn piece of paper, rolled up and tied in place with a string.</p><p>Blu Chu jumped back onto Doc Bandums' shoulder and Shadow took the paper from him. Shadow untied the string and unrolled the piece of paper vertically.</p><p>Shadow gasped, "It's a...a map!"</p><p>Doc Bandum smiled and nodded, "My father was a traveller for 50 years and he gave me this map as a gift. But I'm sure it'll assist you more than me."</p><p>"This map's so old and detailed.." Shadow said, "Are you sure it's alright to give it to us?"</p><p>"I'm sure. As it's a little old, some of it may be out of date."</p><p>"That's alright." Vio said, "It can't have changed that much."</p><p>"Thanks so much. This is such a big help to us!" Green said.</p><p>"Heheh! No problem!" Doc Bandum smiled.</p><p>"Chu chu chu!"</p><p>"Oh, that's right. I almost forgot.." Doc Bandum reached into his pocket and pulled out a bottle with blue jelly in it, "This is Blue Chu Chu jelly, what Blu Chu made for you. It'll help cure anything you get like poison or bad burns. It's Blu Chus' gift to you."</p><p>Doc Bandum handed it to Vio.</p><p>"Wow! Thanks Blu Chu!" Vio said.</p><p>"Chu chuu!"</p><p>The five Links had equiped all their weapons and equipment. Vio had handed in their card key to the receptionist. They had left the five plushies of themselves on the sofa, with a note saying, 'Thankyou for all your help.'</p><p>The five Links walked out the city where there was a large, grassy area with several small hills in the distance.</p><p>"At last, we have a chance to get back to Hyrule.." Green said.</p><p>"You're leaving?"</p><p>The five Links stopped and turned their heads round. As Red turned round, he slipped and fell onto the ground. Ralph was standing just outside the city.</p><p>"Ralph!" Blue ran to him.</p><p>"I was hoping you'd be able to stay longer so I could have a rematch with you.."</p><p>"Hmmm..." Blue held his hand out, "I'll return someday and fight you again. Just promise me you'll get stronger, 'cause I will."</p><p>Ralph smiled and held onto Blues' hand, "Of course I'll get stronger. I really want another fight with you. I promise you, Blue, I will get stronger, for you, as long as you get stronger too. 'Cause we're friends, right?"</p><p>"Right."</p><p>They clutched tightly onto each others' hand and then let go.</p><p>Ralph smiled, "See ya."</p><p>Blue nodded and started to walk to the others.</p><p>Ralph noticed Red sitting on the ground, rubbing the tears away from his eyes.</p><p>"Owchies..That hurt.." Red sniffled.</p><p>"Wow, what a cute girl!" Ralph thought, "She'll be the perfect girlfriend for me!"</p><p>Ralph rushed toward Red, past Blue.</p><p>"Here, I'll help you up." Ralph held onto Reds' hand and pulled him up to his feet.</p><p>Red looked up to Ralph as he held both of Reds' hands in his.</p><p>Ralph looked into Reds' eyes, "Your eyes..they tell me something, like...we should be...Oh! This is too good to be true!" Ralph closed his eyes, "Please, would you have the honour of being.." he opened his eyes, "..my girlfriend!"</p><p>Vios' head perked up, "Hmm?"</p><p>Then Shadows', "Eh?"</p><p>Then Greens', "Huh?"</p><p>Blues' head perked up and his face got angry, "What!"</p><p>"Uuh, I'm sorry. But I'm already in love with Blu-"</p><p>Blue rushed to Red and covered his mouth with his hand, "Come on, Red! We gotta go!"</p><p>Blue pulled Red away from Ralph and they ran with the others.</p><p>"Aw, man. All the cute girls always slip out my hands so easily.." Ralph then sighed.</p><p>"By the way!" Red yelled out.</p><p>Ralphs' head perked up.</p><p>"I'm a boy!"</p><p>"Huh!" Ralph looked shocked and he then fainted back onto the ground.</p>
