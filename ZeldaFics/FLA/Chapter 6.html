<body><div><b>Five Links' Adventures</b></u></p><p><u><b>Chapter 6: Chibi Ganons' Proposal</b></u></p><p>The girl quickly ran inside, up a spiral of stairs, and onto the roof. She blew through a large horn on the rooftop three times.</p><p>She yelled through it, "He's coming! Chibi Ganon's coming! Quickly! Everyone get inside your homes!"</p><p>Everyone scrambled into their houses and all of them locked their doors.</p><p>The hover-car drove into the village. The five Links were confused what to do.</p><p>"Uuuh, where do we hide?" Green asked, shifting his head.</p><p>Red pointed at some bushes, "Quick! There!"</p><p>The five of them scrambled to the bushes and hid behind them. They peeked through to watch what was going on.</p><p>The car stopped outside the castle and Chibi Ganon jumped out. He looked and dressed just like Ganondorf, but was only as tall and old as Link.</p><p>"Princess! Oh princess!" He yelled out, "I'm waiting!"</p><p>The princess walked out the castle and walked to Chibi Ganon.</p><p>"Yes? What do you want this time?" She asked.</p><p>"Well, since we make such a great couple.."</p><p>Chibi Ganon edged closer to the princess and held her hands.</p><p>"Tomorrow," he said, "We will get married!"</p><p>The five Links gasped in shock.</p><p>The princess paused, "And what if I say no?"</p><p>Chibi Ganon grinned, "I'll destroy this village and kill everyone in it with my own two hands!"</p><p>The princess paused, and then sighed, "Fine, I accept."</p><p>"You made the right choice." Chibi Ganon hopped back into his hover-car, "I'll be here at 10 am tomorrow to pick you up. Don't forget!"</p><p>Chibi Ganon drove off, out of the village. The people of the village crept out of their homes and slowly resumed their businesses.</p><p>The princess sighed and slowly walked up the stairs to her castle.</p><p>"Hey." Green said.</p><p>The princess turned her head round and saw the five Links standing behind her.</p><p>"We can help you." Green smiled.</p><p>The princess smiled back at them, "Please, come in."</p>
