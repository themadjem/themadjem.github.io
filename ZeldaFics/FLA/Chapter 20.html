Help me, please!" the voice yelled out again.</p><p>Shadow stood up, "I'll save him."</p><p>Shadow held his hand out and formed a bomb in his hand out of darkness. He pointed at it with the other hand and clicked his fingers. A flame of darkness appeared on the fuse of the bomb.</p><p>Red stood up, "Wow, cool!"</p><p>Shadow smirked, "The Great Light Fairy told me to use my powers wisely." He brought the bomb back, ready to throw it, "Stand clear!"</p><p>He threw the bomb and it blew up the huge rock. It left a dark smoke, and Shadow quickly ran in and lifted the small person then ran out.</p><p>Shadow looked down at him, "You OK, kid?...Wah!"</p><p>Tingle, the small, so-called 'fairy' midget was in Shadows' arms.</p><p>He looked up to Shadow, "Ah! Mr. Hero! " he glomped Shadow, "You saved me again! "</p><p>"Huh!" Shadow dropped Tingle on the ground.</p><p>Tingle got up to his feet and shook the dust off himself.</p><p>He tugged on Shadows' tunic, "But you changed your clothes again! Come on! Make your mind up! You know you looked best in green!"</p><p>"Green?" Shadow turned his head round.</p><p>Blue got up to his feet and walked to the round boulder behind him. He swung his hammer back and then hit the boulder away like a golf ball. Green was revealed behind it and he perked up.</p><p>"Mr. Hero! " Tingle leapt toward Green and latched onto his leg, "I knew you'd come back to me!  Face it! You need me and my wide knowledge, don'tcha? Don'tcha?"</p><p>"Aw man! Get off me!" Green shook his leg.</p><p>"So, you got anymore Force Gems for me?"</p><p>"No! You stole them all!" Green grabbed Tingle by the back, "Just bugger off!"</p><p>Green threw Tingle and he landed on his face. Tingle sat up and rubbed his damaged cheek.</p><p>"Man, this'll be good for the press.." Blue said to Green, "'Hero of Hyrule bullies kid.'"</p><p>"He's a midget!" Green was annoyed.</p><p>"Yeah, but still.."</p><p>Red was knelt down behind Tingle, trying to comfort him.</p><p>"Alas, Tingle is unloved again. All I wish for is a companion to travel with! Someone I can share my wisdom and tales to." Tingle sighed, "No-one loves Tingle.."</p><p>"Hey! Come on! That's not true!" Red said to him, "You just caught us at a bad time. We're on a very important mission to save our friend right now and we don't have much time."</p><p>"Oh, I see." Tingle said, "So, where you heading? I know a lot of shortcuts."</p><p>"The Tower of Fire." Shadow pointed to it.</p><p>"Wa! There!" Tingle was shocked, and then he thought to himself, "The shortcut I know is full of cyclops! But they don't have to know that. What perfect revenge.." Tingle smirked.</p><p>He smiled, "Yeah, I know a really handy shortcut to there! You see that cave?" he pointed to it, "Just go through there. Shouldn't take you too long if you keep a fast pace."</p><p>"Wow! Thanks!" Red said.</p><p>"Sooo, how 'bout some Force Gems for payment?" Tingle held his hand out.</p><p>"We don't have any!" Green drew his sword and shook it, "Our swords are lacking force. We have none."</p><p>"Hmmm..OK, fine." Tingle went up in the air with his balloon, "I guess I'll let you off since you saved me back there. Well, I must be off! Bye!" Tingle waved as he floated away.</p><p>Red waved, "Bye! Thankyou!"</p><p>"Yeah, Green, you're right. Our swords do have no force." Shadow said to him.</p><p>"Hmm." Green withdrew his sword, "It must've reset when it was put back in the shrine."</p><p>Blue ran to the cave, "Come on! Let's go! We can't waste time!"</p><p>"Right!" They ran to the cave.</p><p>Red peered in and Blue walked inside.</p><p>He stopped and turned round, "Come on! You aren't a bunch of scaredy cuccos are ya?"</p><p>Green and Shadow walked in, "Who you calling 'scaredy cucco'?" Green commented.</p><p>They walked through into the darkness.</p><p>"Uh...Hey! Wait up!" Red ran in and clutched onto Blue.</p>
