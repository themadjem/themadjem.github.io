<body><div><b>Five Links' Adventures</b></u></p><p><u><b>Chapter 37: Curing the Transformation</b></u></p><p>The five Links were walking towards a forest, east of Snow Peak. The snow on the ground got thinner as they got further away. Vio and Shadow were holding hands as they were walking along.</p><p>"Nya nya nya!" Red started running to the forest and then tripped into the snow.</p><p>"Careful, Red!" Blue ran to him and helped him up to his feet.</p><p>Red looked at the prints left in the snow, "Nya?" he then looked at his hands and panicked, "Nya nya nya!"</p><p>Green, Vio and Shadow ran to Red and Blue.</p><p>"Woah! Red's got paws!" Green said.</p><p>"We better hurry to that lake." Shadow said.</p><p>"It should be just through that forest." Vio pointed, "Let's go!"</p><p>They started running in and through the forest.</p><p>There was no more snow on the ground. The five Links ran through the forest and then got to a clearing. It was surrounded by bushes and there were entrances at two sides; where the Links were and on the far side of them. In the middle of the clearing was a large, pink lake.</p><p>Blue twitched, "Uh, I'm gonna go take a whiz, guys. I'll be right back!" Blue ran to the left of him, behind some trees.</p><p>"Heheheh! Is it the pepper again?" Green asked.</p><p>"Shut up!" Blue yelled out.</p><p>Vio, Shadow, Green and Red walked up to the lake.</p><p>Vio got out his book, "OK, it says that to cure the transformation, the being must imerse him or herself into the lake.."</p><p>"Nya nya!" Red started running in.</p><p>"Wait, Red! There's more!" Vio panicked.</p><p>Before Vio could continue, Red tripped over a small rock and fell into the lake. The splash caused water to fly out onto Vio, Shadow and Green. There was then a thick puff of smoke where they were standing.</p><p>"OK, guys. I'm back. Huh!" Blue walked back and saw the smoke from where they were.</p><p>The smoke faded away and there were three Koori Neko where Vio, Shadow and Green were standing. They were standing on their clothes which were in messy piles on the ground. Another Koori Neko then climbed its' way out of the lake.</p><p>"Wha! What the hell!" Blue ran to Vios' book which was open on the page he was reading, "'The being will then instantly turn into a Koori Neko then transform back to normal in fifteen minutes. If the water of this lake touches the hair of any other human, they will also turn into a Koori Neko for fifteen minutes.' Oh boy.." Blue closed the book.</p><p>He walked over to the lake and helped the Red Koori Neko out the lake. Red shook the water off himself and Blue held him away.</p><p>"Woah! Careful!" Blue said.</p><p>Blue put Red down next to him and he then fished out Reds' clothes and weapons from the lake. Blue rung them out and then folded them neatly in a pile.</p><p>Blue looked over his shoulder at the four Links who were now Koori Neko.</p><p>He sighed, "Trust those idiots to get transformed this way, heheh." he then looked at their clothes in messy piles, "Huh? Can't have it that way, can we?"</p><p>Blue stood up and walked over to their clothes' piles. He neatly folded them and arranged them in their separate piles. He put Reds' clothes next to them so they were arranged in a row.</p><p>Blue smiled, "There! All neat!" he sat on the grass and looked up to the sky, "Now all we do is wait."</p><p>Blue was lying on the ground, relaxing. The four Koori Neko Links were away from the lake, the other side of Blue.</p><p>Blue sat up, "How long's it been? They should return to normal by now.." he perked up, "Hang on.." he looked at the Koori Neko Links, "..They're gonna transform back to normal.." he then looked at their clothes on the other side of him, "..But their clothes are over here...oh no!"</p><p>Blue lunged for the clothes and collected them all in his arms. The four Koori Neko Links suddenly transformed back in normal in a thick puff of smoke.</p><p>Blue threw their clothes at them, "Guys! Your clothes!"</p><p>Their clothes flew onto them and they fell back. The smoke faded away and their clothes were covering below their waist.</p><p>Vio and Shadow looked at each other and then quickly looked way, blushing. Red was tembling nervously while dressing himself quickly.</p><p>"Wha..what happened?" Green asked.</p><p>Blue was covering his eyes with his hands, "I'll tell you later! Just hurry up and get dressed!"</p><p>The Links were dressed and they were standing up. Blue told them what had happened to them.</p><p>"Huh?" Red perked up, "Yay! I can speak again!"</p><p>Blue smiled, "That's good to hear, heheh!"</p><p>"So, where do we go now?" Red asked.</p><p>"I think we need to go back to Hyrule." Shadow said, "We need to let Zelda know what's going on..if she hasn't been taken away again.."</p><p>"Hmm.." Green was facing the ground, looking puzzled.</p><p>"Is something wrong, Green?" Vio asked.</p><p>Green looked up at them, "I was just thinking, what are we?"</p><p>The others looked at Green, confused.</p><p>"Huh? What do you mean?" Blue asked.</p><p>"Well, if any of us are still related to my dad, or my sister. If we're quintuplets or what? The shrine getting smashed must have given some sort of effect..I'd like to find that out first." Green explained.</p><p>"But, where do we find out?" Red asked.</p><p>"I know where!" Blue started running through the forest on the other side of the lake, "Follow me!"</p><p>The others ran behind Blue, following him through the trees.</p><p>Blue jumped out some bushes onto some stone pavement and pointed up, "There!"</p><p>The others ran out the bushes and stopped behind Blue, "Woah!"</p>
