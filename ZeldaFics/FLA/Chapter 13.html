<body><div><b>Five Links' Adventures</b></u></p><p><u><b>Chapter 13: Time to Fight</b></u></p><p>Shadows' eyes widened as he watched the light come towards him. Just before the light came into his reach, Shadow quickly put his arms in a cross infront of him and a shield of darkness formed around him.</p><p>"Shadow!" Vio yelled.</p><p>Chibi Ganon grinned and forced out a stronger light and Shadows' shield faded slightly.</p><p>"No! Shadow!" Vio reached for him.</p><p>"Guys...hit him...now!" Shadow said.</p><p>"Right!" Green withdrew his sword, "Hyaah!"</p><p>Green threw his boomerang at Chibi Ganons' head. Red shot three pebbles that hit between his eyes. Vio shot three arrows at his chest.</p><p>Chibi Ganon got hit various times and backed away. He covered his head in his hands and the light stopped. The shield around Shadow disappeared and he dropped to the ground.</p><p>"Red! Freeze him!" Blue yelled.</p><p>"Right!" Red replied.</p><p>Red pointed his rod at Chibi Ganon.</p><p>"Ice Rod!" Red yelled as a wave of ice froze Chibi Ganon entirely.</p><p>Blue ran up to Chibi Ganon, brought his hammer up and jumped into the air.</p><p>"Yaaaah! Time for the end of you!" Blue yelled as he swung his hammer down on Chibi Ganon and shattered him to pieces.</p><p>All the small pieces of ice turned into dark smoke which then faded away.</p><p>"Yeah! Alright!" Blue grinned, "Won't be seeing you again!"</p><p>"Yay! We did it!" Red cheered, then bent down and coughed out some blood.</p><p>Blue turned round, "Woah! Red!" Blue equiped his hammer to his belt then ran to Red and put his hands on his back, "Red, you're really beat up. We'll get you back to the castle. Here.."</p><p>Blue walked infront of Red and knelt down.</p><p>"Get on my back. I'll carry you." Blue smiled.</p><p>Red climbed onto his back and held his arms round Blues' neck. Blue stood up and held him on.</p><p>"Remember to concentrate on breathing, ok? Don't worry about me." Blue said.</p><p>"OK." Red replied.</p><p>Vio walked to Shadow who was kneeling on the ground, panting. Vio held his left hand down at him and Shadow looked up.</p><p>"You alright?" Vio smiled.</p><p>"Yeah." Shadow held onto his hand and Vio pulled him up.</p><p>"Come on! Let's get back to the castle!" Blue started running back.</p><p>"Hey! Stop stealing my role!" Green ran after Blue, "I'm the main character here!"</p><p>Vio stepped closer to Shadow, "You were really brave."</p><p>Vio just then kissed Shadow on the cheek. Shadows' eyes widened and he blushed.</p><p>Vio laughed, "Come on!"</p><p>Vio ran after the others and Shadow was being pulled behind him. Shadow just kept staring at Vio, mezmorised.</p>
