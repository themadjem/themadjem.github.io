<body><div><b>Five Links' Adventures</b></u></p><p><u><b>Chapter 7: What is the plan?</b></u></p><p>The princess and the five Links were in the castle, sitting round a table.</p><p>"Let me introduce myself." the princess said, "My name is Tetra. I'm princess Zeldas' younger sister."</p><p>"Ooooh, so that's why you two look so alike." Red commented.</p><p>Tetra smiled, "I remember back when we were little, we used to argue over who would get the bigger castle. Looks like she won, but I think I'm much happier here. It's much more peaceful and the village is so nice."</p><p>"But one thing's not right." Blue said, "Why does Chibi Ganon want to marry you? If I were him I would've gone for Zelda. She seems to have much more wealth."</p><p>Green looked at Blue, "That's very suspicious coming from you."</p><p>"This village isn't protected as much as Hyrule is. He's just gone for me, probably to use me as bait to capture Zelda for his father." Tetra said.</p><p>"Ganondorf, huh?" Green asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Tetra sighed, "Uh, enough about me, please tell me your names!"</p><p>"My name's Green."</p><p>"I'm Blue."</p><p>"I'm Red!"</p><p>"My name's Vio."</p><p>Shadow paused, "Uh, my name's Shadow."</p><p>Tetra looked at him.</p><p>"Uh.." Vio put his hand on Shadows' head and ruffled his hair, "Don't worry about him, he's just a little shy! Eheheheh.."</p><p>Vio put his hand down and Shadow tried to stroke his hair back into place.</p><p>Red was staring at Tetra, fantasizing.</p><p>"Wow, that's such a cute dress, I wish I could wear it." he thought.</p><p>"Hey! I got a plan!" Green said, "You can't beat Chibi Ganon on your own, right?"</p><p>"Yeah.." Tetra said.</p><p>"Well, why doesn't one of us disguise as you tomorrow and then that person can beat Chibi Ganon without him knowing a thing!"</p><p>"That's just crazy enough to work." Blue said.</p><p>"Alright!" Tetra said, "Let's decide who it's gonna be."</p><p>They all got up from their seats and the five Links stood in a row.</p><p>"Now, let's see." Tetra said, "Which one of you looks most like me."</p><p>"Well, I'm definitely counted out." Shadow looked up to his hair, "My hair colour doesn't match yours."</p><p>Shadow thought to himself, "Plus I can't survive on my own out there in the light."</p><p>"Hmmmm..There is one problem though.." Tetra said, "You're all too tall."</p><p>She looked along the row then stopped at Red at the end. She rushed over to him.</p><p>"Except you! You're exactly the right height! Plus you have my eyes! You're perfect!" she excitedly said.</p><p>"W-w-what!" Red was stunned.</p><p>"Makes sense." Blue said, "The dress will only fit on you, Red."</p><p>Reds' face went bright red, he then fainted.</p><p>"Uh, is he alright?" Tetra asked.</p><p>"He loves your dress." Blue said, "His dream is about to come true."</p>
