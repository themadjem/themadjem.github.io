<body><div><b>Five Links' Adventures</b></u></p><p><u><b>Chapter 25: The Killer Bees</b></u></p><p>Far in the north-west, in the middle of the great seas, was a peaceful island named Windfall Island. It consisted of a small town, full of people without a care in the world. This island never suffered any attacks from monsters or huge tides. Only a couple of theiveries from pirates have ever been recorded but they were very minor and didn't cause much damage. The town consisted of a few shops, a small mansion, a school and a huge windmill in the middle.</p><p>Green was sleeping, upside-down. The bottom of his tunic was caught on a high branch of a tree. His sword, shield, boomerang, hat and a small sack of rupees of his were on the ground, below him, where they had fallen off.</p><p>A small boy walked up to the stuff, "Hey, guys. Check this out!"</p><p>Three other boys circled round the stuff, next to the other boy.</p><p>The first boy was called Jan, he was the leader of the group. He wore a red cap and he had ginger hair, with two spikes of it hanging out the front. He wore a blue shirt, a dark blue jacket, a belt and brown, knee-length trousers.</p><p>The second boy was Jin. He had light brown hair, which spiked up like two horns. He had squinted eyes and a biggish, pink nose. He wore a pink shirt and black shorts with dungees.</p><p>The next boy was called Jun. He had blue hair which went right around his head and a pink nose. He wore a dark pink, long-sleeved shirt, a brown jacket and blue shorts.</p><p>The last boy was called Ivan. He had short, brown hair with two spiked up bits in the middle. He had squinted eyes, a big pink nose and a fattish face. He wore a green shirt, grey trousers with white dungees and stripey socks.</p><p>These four boys were known in Windfall as the Killer Bees.</p><p>Jan picked up the sword, "Check it out.." he extracted the sword from its' case a little, "Wow! A sword!"</p><p>Jin picked up the boomarang and Ivan picked up the shield.</p><p>Jun picked up the hat and put it on, "Hehe, who would leave this stuff lying out here?"</p><p>Ivan looked up and pointed at Green, "Hey, look! Do you think this stuff is his?"</p><p>Jan picked up the sack, "You mean was his." he opened the sack and looked in, "Wow! Check out all the rupees!"</p><p>"We could buy way loads with that!" Jin commented.</p><p>Jan closed the sack and grinned, "Hehe, you snooze, you loose! Come on!"</p><p>The Killer Bees then ran into the town, with all of Greens' stuff.</p>
